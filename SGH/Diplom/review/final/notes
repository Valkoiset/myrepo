Deep Reinforcement Learning: training intelligent agent to play game “Flappy Bird” with Evolution Strategy algorithm

Implementation of Evolution Strategy algorithm on example of mobile game "Flappy Bird".
The objective is to prove that Evolution Strategy algorithm may be used for solving Reinforcement Learning problems and be as sufficient as older, proven to be effective algorithms, such as: Q-learning, SARSA, DQN, DDPG, A3C.
