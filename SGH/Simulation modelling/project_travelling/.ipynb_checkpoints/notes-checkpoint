helped with ortools:
https://github.com/google/or-tools/issues/1291

# had to downgrade version of library
pip install ortools==6.7.4973
or
python -m pip install ortools==6.7.4973

# later installed this one and also works:
python -m pip install ortools==7.3.7083


# check tools version:
python -m pip show ortools

Conclusion
note: of course our analysis would be much more accurate if we took into account the actual cost of usage of heavy-weight and light-weight cars, we know that and it's just another point of simulation we may improve in the future.
