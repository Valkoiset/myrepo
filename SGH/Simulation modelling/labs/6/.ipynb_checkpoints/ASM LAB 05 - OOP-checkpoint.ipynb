    "`Programming paradigms` are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common programming paradigms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `imperative` in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,\n",
    "    - `procedural` which groups instructions into procedures,\n",
    "    - `object-oriented` which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on,\n",
    "- `declarative` in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it\n",
    "    - `functional` in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,\n",
    "    - `logic` in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,\n",
    "    - `mathematical` in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, `imperative programming` uses statements that change a program's state and focuses on describing how a program operates. An imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. The focus of `procedural programming` is to break down a programming task into a collection of variables, data structures, and subroutines (also termed procedures, functions), whereas in `object-oriented programming` it is to break down a programming task into objects that expose behavior (methods) and data (members or attributes) using interfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, `declarative programming` is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs,that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow (the how being left up to the language's implementation). In `functional programming` programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that each return a value, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which change the state of the program or world. `Logic programming` is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in a logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. `Mathematical programming` is the selection of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives.\n",

    "\n",
    "`Object-oriented programming` (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of `objects` which can contain data, in the form of `fields` (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of `procedures` (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of \"this\" or \"self\"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.\n",

    "### 3.1. Python Scopes and Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A `namespace` is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python dictionaries, e.g.: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as abs(), and built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation. In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. There is absolutely no relation between names in different namespaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "Namespaces are created at different moments and have different lifetimes. The namespace containing the built-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. The global namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in. The local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "References to names in modules are attribute references: in the expression modname.funcname, modname is a module object and funcname is an attribute of it. In this case there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module’s attributes and the global names defined in the module: they share the same namespace!\n",
    "\n",
    "A `scope` is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible” here means that an unqualified reference to a name attempts to find the name in the namespace. `'__main__` is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. The `__name__` is a special Python variable as it gets its value depending on how we execute the containing script. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. At any time during execution, there are at least three nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:\n",
    "- the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names\n",
    "- the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope\n",
    "- the next-to-last scope contains the current module’s global names\n",
    "- the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g.: if a name is declared global, then all references and assignments go directly to the middle scope containing the module’s global names."
